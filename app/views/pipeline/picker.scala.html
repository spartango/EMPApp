                    Particle picking find single objects, or <em>particles</em>, from large images for individual analysis later on.
                    The goal here is to select individual protein molecules or complexes, ignoring anything else in the images. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to do this, EMP must be able to tell the difference between relevant objects and background noise and debris. 
                    EMP assumes that the individual particles have contrast from the background, and are contiguous and distinct from one another. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To actually pick the particles, EMP blurs the images twice to get just the rough shapes of objects. 
                    It then uses a contrast threshold to find individual proteins, and draw a bounding box around each them.
